📝 Project Description

The AI Tutor is a sophisticated learning ecosystem designed to bridge the gap between complex artificial intelligence and student accessibility. By integrating a high-performance React frontend with a robust Python-based API, the platform provides real-time academic support, dynamic quiz generation and personalized study paths. The system utilizes Asynchronous API calls to process natural language queries, allowing students to receive instant context-aware feedback, simulated examinations and curated resource recommendations based on their unique learning progress (this mainly focuses on me learning the frontend frameworks and in backend we are using a API).
